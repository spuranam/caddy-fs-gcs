description: "caddy-fs-gcs: Fetch and triage PR review comments for the current branch. Analyzes comments, fixes issues, and responds/resolves threads via gh CLI."
agent: "pr-reviewer"
argument-hint: "Optional: PR number or leave blank to use current branch"

Address unresolved PR review comments. Use `gh` CLI and the
**GitHub GraphQL API (v4)** to fetch review threads --
the REST API does not expose the `isResolved` field.

Follow these phases **in order** -- do not skip ahead:

1. **Fetch**: Fetch all review threads via GraphQL; **skip comments that are already resolved or outdated**
2. **Early exit**: If there are **zero unresolved threads**, report that and stop -- do not triage or apply fixes
3. **Triage**: For each unresolved comment, assess whether it's
   a legit problem with the code. Present the triage summary with
   recommendations and **stop here** -- the user will click
   "Apply fixes" to approve
4. **Apply fixes**: Fix the code, verify build (`go build ./...`,
   `go vet ./...`), run tests (`task test`), then respond to and
   resolve each addressed thread
5. **Coverage check**: After fixes pass, run `task coverage:check` and ensure 85%+ is maintained
6. If you disagree with a comment:
   **explain your reasoning in the reply and resolve it anyway** --
   do not leave threads open
7. **Do not commit** -- I will handle that
